I have been having some difficulty making the code work with the code structure 
I planned out.

Structure:
	Screen:
		- Contains Scenes. The Screen switches between scenes depending on which
		  button is clicked
	Scene:
		- What the user currently sees on the screen. The user can see the 'start'
		  scene which has button objects and textbox objects when the program is run.
		  There is also the "play" scene, "exit" scene and "end" scene.
		- Scene objects are TextBox(s), Button(s), Board, Disk(s)
	Board:
		- Contains disks
	Button:
		- Only three buttons will be made from the program start to end. These buttons
		  will be traded between scenes
	TextBox:
		- Will be remade for each scene
		
The game does not work as well as it does on the master branch.
