This textfile contains my thought process/notes behind the changes and additions to the project plan.

I made the name of the game "4-to-Connect" in order to avoid copyright infringement.
I wrote the milestones section. The milestones may not be specific enough but it looks okay for now.
For the risks I took away the "Someone drops course" part because it currently isn't relevent to our project. At least for now.
TO-DO: Who is responsible for submitting deliverables? Who is responsible for checking if other members need help?
I changed "An 6x5 board" to "A 6x5 board".
I changed the stakeholders section, means of communication section and risks section to be in full sentences. I think that
is required for the project plan.
I added Class diagram and Case Diagram to the internal deliverables section becuase the project doesn't request them (I think).
I may have made some more or less changes than this but this is what I remember I did. You can compare the changes to the master branch.
