# 4-to-Connect
4-to-Connect is a computer program created using python and Pygame. It is based on the classic game Connect 4.

# Game Description

# Game Controls
Users interact with the program with a mouse. Once 4-to-Connect is run, a user must press the start button in order to start game play. The first user to make a move will be player 1 and use red disks. The second user to make a move will use yellow disks and become player 2. When it is a players turn to make a move, they must click the unfilled column that they would like to drop a disk in. This unfilled column will be highlighted grey. The disk representing their colour will appear in the last empty slot of the column and the other player can then make a move.
