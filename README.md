# 4-to-Connect
4-to-Connect is a computer program created using python and Pygame. It is based on the classic game Connect 4.

# Game Description

# Game Controls
Users interact with the program with a mouse. Once 4-to-Connect is run, a user must press the start button in order to start game play. The first user to make a move will be player 1 and use red disks. The second user to make a move will use yellow disks and become player 2. When it is a players turn to make a move, they must click the unfilled column that they would like to drop a disk in. This unfilled column will be highlighted grey. The disk representing their colour will appear in the last empty slot of the column and the other player can then make a move.

4-to-Connect does not allow users to view the start page from the play page. To allow this, one can add to the update_screen method so that buttons can beplaced on the screen if self.isPlaying is True.

# Individual Contributions

Hafsah Moalim:

I contributed to this project's code by creating the class skeleton for ConnectFourGUI and filling in some of its methods. In particular, I created the help page and start page for the game. In the init method for ConnectFourGUI, I used the Button class to  allow switching between the help and start page. I also made the create_text function  to make text appear on the screen. For the README file, I created section headers and  filled in some of the game controls and code extension sections.
